## Weather App

A simple and intuitive weather application built with React that allows users to search for real-time weather information for any city worldwide. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

+ Real-Time Weather Data: Get current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
+ City Search: Search for weather details by entering a city name.
+ Dynamic Icons: Weather conditions are represented with visually appealing icons (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
+ Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
+ Error Handling: Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid city names or API issues.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
